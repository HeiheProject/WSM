# Watershed System model
## (1) Description
A watershed system model was developed using the case of the Heihe River basin (HRB), a typical endorheic river basin in Northwest China, via the collective efforts of various research groups from different disciplines. The watershed system model is mainly composed of four components: (i) an ecohydrological model developed by loosely coupling the geomorphology-based ecohydrological model (GBEHM,https://github.com/gb03/GBEHM) designed for the mountainous cryosphere with the hydrological-ecological integrated watershed-scale flow (HEIFLOW,https://github.com/DeepHydro/WRA) model designed for oasis and desert areas; (ii) a socioeconomic model integrated by the macroeconomic-based water-economic model (WEM) and the micro-behavior-based agent-based model (ABM); and (iii) two interface models including the land-use and water resource models.

## (2) Usage
Source code: The source code of the watershed system model is located in the Source code folder, in which the main program is WSM. 
Environment configuration: (i) the CGE model dependency environment Java 1.8.7 is firt installed, and then (ii) the CGE model is installed through the installation wizard in the CGE file (in the CGE folder). Test data: test data are in SSP1-max (project configuration file), configuration files (scenario initialization file, SDG metrics file, model baseline data file).
Test data: test data are partly located in the SSP1-max folder which includes the project configuration file, and are partly located in the configuration folder that includes the scenario initialization file, SDG metrics file, model baseline data file.
